Welcome to INESC TEC Renewable Energy Community (REC) Sizing API.

A REST API for **sizing and planning the long-term operation** of a Renewable Energy Community (REC) or
Citizen Energy Community (CEC) that can promote the minimization of the membersâ€™ operation cost with energy.
This tool was developed under the *Enershare* project.

Developers // Contacts:

* Armando Moreno (armando.moreno@inesctec.pt)
* Pedro Macedo (pedro.m.macedo@inesctec.pt)
* Ricardo Silva (ricardo.emanuel@inesctec.pt)


# Run API
Run the API locally with uvicorn:
```shell
$ uvicorn main:app 
```
(For development, you can include the ```--reload``` tag at the end).

# Swagger and Redoc
To access the interactive API docs, include the following at the end of the URL where uvicorn is running: 
- ```/docs``` (Swagger format);
- ```/redoc``` (ReDoc format);

# Docker
A dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file have been prepared for and 
easy deployment of the service on any server.

On a server with docker engine, docker-compose and git installed:

- clone this repository to the server;
- create the ```.env``` file on the project's base directory
- run the command ```docker-compose up -d --build``` (Windows) / 
```sudo docker compose up -d --build``` (Linux)
